ex-Fuzzy is a fuzzy toolbox library for Python with special focus in its accesibility to use and visualization of results. In this way, we focus on the ex(-Fuzzy)plainable capacities of approximate reasoning.

Some of the tools available in this library include:

- Support for approximate reasoning using fuzzy association rules, for both classification and regression problems. This includes rule base optimization using genetic algorithms and rule visualization.
- Precomputed and optimized fuzzy variables and their correspondent linguistic variables (i.e low, medium, high).
- Support for various kinds of fuzzy sets, including classic fuzzy sets, IV-fuzzy sets and General Type 2 fuzzy sets.
